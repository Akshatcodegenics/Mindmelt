###🧠 How It Works

The reader opens an article.

With consent, the webcam captures micro-expressions and sends anonymized emotion data.

The AI model classifies emotion (e.g., joy, fear, anger).

The backend logs data and visualizes mood trends.

Editors see real-time mood metrics per article.

📊 Example Use Cases

Editors: Optimize headlines and tone based on engagement data.

Readers: Get recommendations matching their current mood.
